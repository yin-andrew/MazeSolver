# MazeSolver
"Solves" binary square matrices given 

This project solves a binary maze using stacks. 

Requirements:A maze is a square space with an entrance at the upper left-hand corner, an exit at thelower right-hand corner, and some internal walls.  Your algorithm will find a path through a given maze,starting from the entrance and finishing at the exit that does not go through any walls (a valid path mustgo around walls).Your program will take a command line argument, the filename (e.g.  maze1.txt) for the maze description.(To input a command line argument in Eclipse or IntelliJ, you can click “Run” – “Run Configurations” –“Arguments” and then type in the argument in the “Program Arguments” box.)  Your program next printsthe maze to stdout,  then tries to find a path through the maze.  If a path is found,  the maze should beprinted while indicating which positions were visited during the search,  and a success message should beshown:Maze is solvable.  Otherwise, an error message is printed:Maze is NOT solvable.The maze will be represented as anN×Narray of 1s and 0s; ifmaze[i][j] == 1then there is an internalwall in that position of the maze.  Otherwise, there is no wall.  The search algorithm will start atmaze[0][0]and find a path tomaze[N-1][N-1].  A path is represented by a sequence of[i][j]position coordinates,starting with[0][0]and ending with[N-1][N-1].  Fromposition[i][j]in the path, the next position inthe path can only be the position to the left, right, up or down fromposition[i][j]; a path cannot movediagonally from one position to another.
